Neither of these procedures are difficult if you follow the steps carefully.

To update the javadoc
---------------------

1. You check out into your Eclipse workspace the master branch of the IPAddress Eclipse project in the IPAddress repository which contains this file.
https://github.com/seancfoley/IPAddress

2. You check out into your Eclipse workspace the master branch of the "Functional Doclet for Javadoc" Eclipse project in the Functional-Doclet-for-Javadoc repository.
https://github.com/seancfoley/Functional-Doclet-for-Javadoc

3. You run the build.xml ant task to generate the javadoc into the javadoc folder in the IPAddress project

4. In eclipse you switch the IPAddress project to the local gh-pages branch.  Do not commit the javadoc files before doing so.  
Since those files do not belong to any branch, they will remain in your IPAddress project as you switch branches.

5. Once in gh-pages, you cut and paste the new javadoc files from the uncommitted javadoc folder to the apidocs folder, overwriting the old ones

6. You commit and push the new contents in the apidocs folder.

Done.

To update the gh-pages docs
---------------------------

1. The master file for the docs is the docs.odt file checked into the IPAddress Eclipse project in the IPAddress repository which contains this file.
You edit that file first.  But that contains only the content, and not the menu and links on the left side.

2. When you are done, you save your changes to the odt file.  Then you save as a filtered html file using MS Word.  
If you are using some other word processor you would save as html but at the moment the online file was generated from Word.

3. In the gh-pages branch of the IPAddress repository, you edit the file index.html.  
At this point in time I have just been using the github editor which works directly on the github repo and thus no push will be required, just a commit.

4. Inside index.html, there are two sections that can be replaced: the <style> in the html header, and the content inside the <section> tags.
There are comments that denote the start and end.

5. Optional: Typically you do not need to replace the style, but if so, you simply cut and paste the corresponding <style> from the header in the word html file into the index.html file.
If you do replace the style, note that I had to delete the "a:visited" and "a:link" strings in that <style> section which were not needed but interfered with the existing styles in the page.
You do not delete the style settings for them because the setting also applied to some MS Word style class or div.  See the diff for the check-in "adjust link colors"

6. You cut and paste the <div class=WordSection1> section from the word file inside the <section> section in the index.html file

7. You commit the index.html file in the github repository.

Done.
